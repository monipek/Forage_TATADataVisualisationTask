# TATA Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights Task

## Project Overview
As part of The Forage's TATA Data Visualization Virtual Experience Program, I completed a task focused on transforming raw sales data into actionable business insights using Tableau. The goal was to analyse an online retail dataset, by cleaning it, and creating visualisations that would guide the CEO and CMO in making expansion decisions.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
Before any analysis could begin, I performed data quality checks to ensure the dataset was reliable. This involved:
- Filtering out invalid entries, such as negative quantities (returns), zero/negative unit prices (input errors) as well as nulls in the customer id column.
- Standardising country names (e.g., renaming "EIRE" to "Ireland") to avoid inconsistencies in geographic analysis.

The project required building four different visualisations in Tableau, each addressing a specific business question:

### 1. Monthly Revenue Trends (2011)
- A line chart showing revenue fluctuations throughout 2011.
- Identified seasonal peaks (e.g., November's £1.2M high, possibly due to Black Friday) and troughs (January's post-holiday slump).
- Insight: Recommending increased inventory and promotions ahead of Q4 to maximize holiday sales.

### 2. Top 10 Revenue-Generating Countries (Excluding UK)
- A bar chart ranking countries by revenue and units sold.
- Highlighted top markets: Netherlands (£285K), Ireland (£266K), and Germany (£229K).
- Insight: Prioritising marketing and logistics investments in these high-performing regions.

### 3. Top 10 Customers by Revenue
- A sorted bar chart displaying the highest-spending customers. When you hover on a bar you can see the country of given customer.
- Revealed that the top 3 customers contributed 18% of the total revenue.
- Insight: Implementing loyalty programs to retain these high-value clients.

### 4. Global Demand Heatmap
- A color-coded world map visualising revenue concentration with labels of revenue in each country.
- Classified markets by colour, showing clearly where demand is the highest and lowest.
- Insight: Exploring localised fulfilment centres in top demand countries to reduce shipping costs.

## Conclusion
This project was a good opportunity to apply real-world data analysis techniques in a business context. By cleaning, visualizing, and interpreting sales data, I helped uncover growth opportunities and operational efficiencies for a hypothetical retail expansion strategy.
